    <h1> Smol Learnings </h1>

    The plan with this page is to write out detailed notes from what I learn in university. 
    I'm worried that I'll forget everything or half-ass the learning and just waste a bunch of money. 
    This collection of lessons should force me to understand the content, help be remember it in the long run, 
    and if they're good maybe I can sell them in the end. 
    
    We'll see how it goes.
