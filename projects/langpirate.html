    <h1> Lang Pirate </h1>

    <h2> Idea </h2>
    When I was in the first grade, there was a set of books about pirates.
    They started out extremely simple, just talking about the colours of the pirate's clothes, 
    and got more complex as you read. They gradually developed a plot and kept the reader hooked on the story. 
    They were designed to help us learn how to read. As you read the books, their reading level increased and to get the 
    next part of the story, you had to up your game. 
    <br><br>
    I want to make a platform that takes a similar approach to learning languages. 
    You would read a simple story in your target language and gradually develop your comprehension as the story progressed. 
    Think Duolingo but less random sentences and more fun story time. 

    <h2> Steps </h2>

    <ul>
        <li> Nice UI </li>
        <li> Write Stories </li>
        <li> Translate Stories </li>
        <li> Users & Payments </li>
        <li> Marketing ?? </li>
    </ul>
